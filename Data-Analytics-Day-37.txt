Topics & Explanations – Day 37

1)Business Forecasting with Time Series
======================================
Forecasting helps businesses predict future outcomes (sales, demand, costs) using past data.
Techniques: Moving Averages, ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing.

Example: Predicting monthly revenue for an e-commerce store.


2)Predictive Modeling Basics
=============================
Predictive models use historical data to make future predictions.
Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.

Example: Predicting customer churn probability in telecom.


3)Anomaly Detection
====================
Detects unusual patterns that don’t fit expected behavior.
Methods: Z-Score, Isolation Forest, DBSCAN clustering.

Example: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.


4)Market Basket Analysis (Association Rules)
===========================================
Identifies patterns in customer purchases.
Uses concepts like Support, Confidence, Lift.

Example: Customers who buy bread often buy butter → retail recommendation.


5)Case Study: Forecasting Sales for a Retail Chain
===============================================
Dataset: Daily/weekly sales data from multiple stores.
Steps: Data preprocessing → Time series forecasting → Anomaly detection for sales spikes → Market basket analysis for product promotions.

Insights: Helps in inventory planning, promotion targeting, and profit maximization.
